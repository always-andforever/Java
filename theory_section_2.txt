What is Java :

General purpose --->  not constrined to just one platform, can be used for wide varienty of applications
object oriented ---> helps to models real world scenarios in a more natural way.
platform independent ---> write once run anywhere (regardless of operating system)
concurrunt ---> promoted mutithreading (perform multiple activities at the same time)
Very fast


Java has automatic memeory management (using garbage collection). Programmers doen't have to directly manipulate memory
to free up space like c and c++.
